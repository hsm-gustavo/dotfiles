### Credits
Pretty much every color scheme is from [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin). Polybar design is from [ericmurphyxyz](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/dotfiles), modified for my needs. Rofi theme is from [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/rofi/tree/main/deathemonic) too, modified to combine with the polybar theme and because some icons are broken. The wallpaper is from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/crmlwi/you_look_lonely_1920_x_1080/). For the picom config, I used (Spaxly's config)[https://github.com/Spaxly/dotfiles/tree/main].
